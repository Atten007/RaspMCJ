# RaspMCJ
This is the Java version of my completely free Minecraft-server software RaspMC which is originally written in Python 3.6.8. It is only intended for the Minecraft: Pi Edition and the Raspberry Pi 4B. You need:
- at least 128MB RAM
- 1GB Micro SD Card Storage
- a Raspberry Pi 4B that is running the Minecraft: Pi Edition on it
- and the JDK 17 or newer
